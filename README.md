## 🛠 **Installation & Setup**

1. **Dependencies**: 
    - Ensure you have the `MPU6050_tockn` and `Wire` libraries installed.
    - You'll also need the `Servo` library for motor interfacing.

2. **Configuration**: 
    - Adjust the PWM_MAX and PWM_MIN constants as per your hardware requirements.
    - Fine-tune the PID parameters (kp, ki, kd) for optimal flight performance.

3. **Deployment**:
    - Upload the code to your microcontroller.
    - Test in a controlled environment before any extended flights.

## 🚀 **Usage**

1. **Initialization**: Power up your quadcopter and ensure all motors and sensors are correctly connected.
2. **Calibration**: Prior to the first flight, place your quadcopter on a stable surface and allow for automatic gyro calibration.
3. **Flight**: Use your remote control to enjoy a seamless flight experience with the assurance of advanced stabilization.
